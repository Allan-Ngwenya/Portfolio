            <p>
              Learning about new technology and training to improve my skilset is something that I enjoy and take pride
              in
              doing. My tenacious drive and
              curiosity has recently lead me to embark on the journey of becoming a Full-Stack Javascript developer. I
              hope to combine the experience that I have
              working in cloud with some solid programming skills to become an all round engineer. Follow me on this
              journey and check out the cool projects I have
              put together!

                <h2>Doctor Care Anywhere – Azure DevOps Engineer</h2>
                <p>
                  I am currently employed by Doctor Care Anywhere as an Azure DevOps Engineer. Since joining the DevOps
                  team I have been a vocal point in setting working standards such as how our development lifecycle
                  should operate in the new world. I brought my knowledge of how to operate in the best way with
                  multi-repo, mono-repo strategies and how the pipelines should implement configurations. Working with
                  Jenkins and BitBucket in previous roles has helped me conceptualise how pipelines in ADO should be
                  configured using best practice. An example of one of the main projects I have planned then implemented
                  successfully is how to leverage terraform for the best alerting/monitoring solutions. Due to the
                  current structure of the growing team, I carry out a lot of proof-of-concept work with new technology
                  such as GitOps tools like flux/ArgoCD and Terraform CAF alongside our cloud architect or developer
                  technical lead. Occasionally I am required to help Dev teams meet their targets and goals by having
                  meetings to discuss what they need infrastructure wise and how to deploy it. Upon joining the company,
                  I made a conscious decision to push myself to be more of a senior. The work I am producing now not
                  only has a working solution in code that can be used, but also a lot of documentation or overview
                  sessions on how I arrived to the solution and how to utilise it.

                <h2>Barclays – Public Cloud Deployment Developer</h2>
                <p>
                  At Barclays I was working as Public Cloud Developer. My role on a day to day basis involved working
                  with Infrastructure as Code tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, Chef and Jenkins to provision
                  then configure the infrastructure in our cloud. I worked end to end taking infrastructure as code
                  proof of concepts and turning them into best practice examples for teams within the Bank to use. I
                  always want to stretch myself through trying new tasks to help make me a more all rounded engineer.
                  Although my main focus was IaC I completed automation tasks, whether it be in Python or PowerShell. As
                  a Barclays employee I was regularly reviewed for my performance and I take pride in knowing that I was
                  given ratings of ‘Good’ for all of the core values (Respect, Integrity, Service, Stewardship,
                  Excellence). Due to my previous experience working in a corporate company, I have learned how to deal
                  with extreme deadlines and how to be successful under pressure while also enjoying the challenges at
                  hand. My teamwork skills are extensively exercised due to the agile way of working I was in. I worked
                  alongside different types of people from SME's to scrum masters, which shows that I am comfortable and
                  enjoy communicating with different types of people. My experience prior to joining Lloyds Banking
                  Group/Barclays was heavily customer service orientated, which provided me with an insight into how to
                  communicate with customers and how to deliver a product that meets all of their needs. I take pride in
                  my work ethic because I appreciate the journey of being able to move through the stages required to go
                  from a beginner to an expert.

                <h2>Lloyds Banking Group - Public Cloud Site Reliability Engineer (July 2019 -August 2020)</h2>
                <p>
                  My interest in cloud computing and the implications of network security at the virtualisation level is
                  something that drew me towards the role. Working in a big team with constant workflow means that on a
                  regular basis I am learning new concepts and learning how to carry out a range of different tasks. As
                  a
                  young man in the early years of his IT career, I see the importance in developing my technical skills
                  and stretching myself at every opportunity. My technical ability has improved at Lloyds Public Cloud,
                  due to my constant involvement in; the provisioning different types of infrastructure (Virtual
                  machines,
                  Storage accounts and key vaults) with a range of industry recognised tools for compliance and
                  automation. On a day to day basis I also build CI/CD pipelines, create/implement network security
                  group
                  rules, complete whitelist requests and work closely with industry recognised monitoring tools for
                  cloud
                  platforms. My management skills in a cloud engineering context are also strong, which is something I
                  demonstrate at Lloyds Banking Group by handling our Vulnerabilities, SOC interactions.

                <h2>Lloyds Banking Group - Junior Java Developer</h2>
                <p>
                  Working at my previous lab has taught me how to be resilient in tough situations, calm in tense
                  scenarios and how to work and learn simultaneously. My technical skills have been sharpened during my
                  time at this Lloyds lab as on a day to day basis I was shadowing senior Java programmers and also
                  developing/ testing code. My knowledge of the software development life cycle and agile development
                  has
                  grown at my time working as Junior Java developer. As an apprentice at Lloyds it was important to have
                  an in-depth overview of what you're working towards as a developer, which is why I was also involved
                  in
                  IT architecture plans.

            <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
            <p>One of my first big projects using Javascript was Tic-Tac-Toe, a game which I made using HTML for the UI
              structure, CSS to make it look good
              and Javascript to handle the games logic. For more information on how I executed this project visit <a

            <h2>Intercative Map</h2>
            <p>My intractive Javscript map has some similar dynamic attributes to Google Maps, such as the ability to
              zoom
              in and out of locations.
              The game will be made using Javascripts framework JQuery to help familiarise myself with one of the most
              widely used libaries of code. If you'd like to have a try, visit <a

            <p>Javascript is widely used in large organisations, and one of the roles I may find mysef in could require
              handling large amounts of user data a bit like the 'To-Do list' program.Test out your skills and stay
